        <p>Hi! My name is Yuqiao Xu, it's pronounced "Yee-Ciao Shew".
          <br>
          <br>
          I am currently a second-year master's student studying Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan. Previously, I was an Information Science and Technology + Graphic Design student at Penn State. 
          <br>
          <br>
          A lot of my inspiration in design came from my crossed-culture background and daily observation of life. I love design because it's a way to admit that I don't know everything and put myself in others' shoes. It's a humbling experience.  
          <br>
          <br>
          A quote by Joe Sparano stated that "good design is obvious and great design is invisible." As I am dwelling on this phrase's true meaning, I want to become someone who creates meaningful, thoughtful, and user-centered experiences and designs.</p>
