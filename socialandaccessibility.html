      <h2> Reading Summary</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        This week’s readings shed light on the contemporary phenomenon of mental health, social media, and the problem of structural policies when using technology to help people with mental health illnesses. The first article emphasizes the importance of viewing mental illness through the context of everyday life instead of analyzing it as a stand-alone subject on social media. It criticizes how current researchers and designers quickly fall into the trap of labeling posts as negative or positive  (Feuston & Piper, 2019). For an instant, it’s easy to be triggered to think of someone’s post as disrupting and negatively influencing other users. While disclosing mental health-related remarks (such as suicidal thoughts) should be protected by the basis of freedom of speech and human expression. It shouldn’t be restrictive and controlled in a certain way. Moreover, one of the participants considers social media (Instagram) as a place for validation, and people should feel just to share their voices, even though those are painful and death-related comments (Feuston & Piper, 2019).

        <p> Similarly, the article written by Professor Adalibi highlights ways people respond and support sensitive self-disclosures. While most of the replies to those self-disclosure are supportive and emotionally soothing rather than instrumental, many can be considered cognitive interventions. And the act of ‘cheering up’ can impose one’s social value on what’s good or bad and lead to the latent desire to correct someone’s thoughts and behavior (Andalibi et al., 2017). </p>

        On the other hand, the third article describes how technology and suicide hotlines play a role in people with mental illness in India. It also highlights several critical issues on a structural and individual level. Those include but are not limited to the unpredictable wait time, the unclear purpose of the hotline and guidelines on how to use those suicidal hotlines, and the cultural stigma and burden around sharing mental health problems (Pendse et al., 2021). The author, in the end, also contributed to the HCI community with a list of recommendations on both structural and individual levels, highlighting the need for feedback and clear communications (Pendse et al., 2021).
