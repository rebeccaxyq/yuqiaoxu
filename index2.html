        <p>Blog posts will consist of a list of reading reflections that I found meaningful and exciting over two years. They will also include personal writing about the design and tech industry. This section is a space to document and record my ideas and thoughts, also, as a way to ‘force’ myself to write more in the future. Currently, there is only one blog post in the section. It’s a reading reflection that I have done for my accessibility class. It covers three academic readings that focus on the topic of mental health, social media, and the design around those topics. Scholars raise the question of freedom of speech and the critical importance of self-disclosure and also criticize different policies and design practices around regulating people’s expression. </p>

            <p>Growing up I have always loved art and taking photos. During my four years of college, I have taken many graduation photos for my friends and clients. I have also travelled to different cities and capture beautiful moments across different seasons. In this gallery I am displaying a small section of my work. Majority of them are portrait photography. Hopefully in the future I can take more landscape photographies and learn more techniques around that.
